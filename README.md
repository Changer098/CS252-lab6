# Dino Dash
Dino Dash is a game where you play as a dinosaur and must dodge obstacles as you run. You can play by yourself to achieve the ultimate high score or compete against a friend in a battle between who can last longer. This project was made for CS252 at Purdue University and was hosted with Microsoft Azure using a custom built RESTful API.
